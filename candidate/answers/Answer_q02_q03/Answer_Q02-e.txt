The Anibis.ch platform showed improved performance compared to Anibis, as seen from the December to January comparison of the platform switch. The product "Tennis Racket" on Anibis.ch had very good results and should be continued to be promoted. However, there is a red flag for the product "Glass Bottle" as its sales dropped 4 times in January compared to December, with 8 sold in December and only 2 sold in January. It's important to note that the lower number of listings for Glass Bottle and higher number of listings for Tennis Racket could be the reason for this discrepancy.

On the other hand, the Tutti.ch platform had no sold products in December, which could be due to the replacement of Tutti with Tutti.ch. However, in January, Tutti.ch already sold 4 products."
